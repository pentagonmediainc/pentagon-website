# Pentagon Media Inc. — Static Site

This folder is ready to upload to GitHub Pages.

## Quick steps
1) Create a new repo on GitHub (public is fine).
2) Upload **all files and folders in this directory** to the repo root (index.html must be at the top level).
3) In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, **Branch** = `main` (or `master`), **Folder** = `/ (root)`.
4) (Optional) For a custom domain, add your domain in **Settings → Pages** and follow GitHub's DNS instructions. If you know your domain now, rename `CNAME.sample` to `CNAME` and put your domain on a single line in that file before uploading.
